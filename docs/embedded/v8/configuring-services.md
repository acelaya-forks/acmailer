# Configuring services

We have seen how to configure and send emails, but we also need to configure the services that send them.

The configuration for all mail services has to be defined under the `acmailer_options.mail_services` configuration entry.

```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

return [

    'acmailer_options' => [
        'mail_services' => [

            'default' => [
                'transport' => 'smtp',
                'transport_options' => [
                    'host' => 'smtp.gmail.com',
                    'port' => 587,
                    'connection_class' => 'login',
                    'connection_config' => [
                        'username' => 'my-email@gmail.com',
                        'password' => 'foobar',
                        'ssl' => 'tls',
                    ],
                ],
            ],

            'mycompany' => [
                'transport' => 'smtp',
                'transport_options' => [
                    'host' => 'smtp.mycompany.com',
                    'port' => 25,
                    'connection_class' => 'login',
                    'connection_config' => [
                        'username' => 'no-reply@mycompany.com',
                        'password' => 'foobar',
                    ],
                ],
            ],

            // Define other services here
        ],
    ],

];
```

> See the full configuration documentation [here](/configuration-options?id=mail-services).

Then, every service can be fetched using the same pattern to compose the service name. Three parts, separated by dots. The first one is **acmailer**, the second one is **mailservice**, and the third one is the specific service name, for example **default** or **mycompany**.

In the example, service names would be **acmailer.mailservice.default** and **acmailer.mailservice.mycompany**.

All services will work from scratch, since this module registers an abstract factory that creates them. However, it is recommended to explicitly register them as factories, which is more efficient (the **default** service comes already preregistered as factory).

```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

use AcMailer\Service\Factory\MailServiceAbstractFactory;

return [
    
    'dependencies' => [ // 'services_manager' in the case of Laminas MVC
        'factories' => [
            'acmailer.mailservice.mycompany' => MailServiceAbstractFactory::class,
        ],
    ],
    
];
```

### Dynamic runtime configuration

Sometimes it is not possible to know the configuration of a mail service, usually because it is dynamically generated at runtime (for example, because your users provide it and you persist it somewhere).

For those cases, this module provides a `AcMailer\Service\MailServiceBuilder` service which can be used to build MailServices at runtime.

It is capable of not only creating services from scratch, but also using pre-configured services where you just want to override some of the config options.

```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

class IndexControllerFactory
{
    public function __invoke($container): IndexController
    {
        $mailServiceBuilder = $container->get(AcMailer\Service\MailServiceBuilder::class);
        return new IndexController($mailServiceBuilder);
    }
}

class IndexController
{
    public function __construct(AcMailer\Service\MailServiceBuilderInterface $mailServiceBuilder)
    {
        $this->mailServiceBuilder = $mailServiceBuilder;
    }

    public function sendContactAction(): Laminas\View\Model\ViewModel
    {
        $mailService = $this->mailServiceBuilder->build('acmailer.mailservice.default', [
            'transport_options' => [
                'connection_config' => [
                    'username' => $currentUser->getMailUser(),
                    'password' => $currentUser->getMailPassword(),
                ],
            ],
        ]);
        $result = $mailService->send('notification');
        return new Laminas\View\Model\ViewModel(['result' => $result]);
    }
}
```

> Notice that the service name you use needs to exist in the configuration, at least as an empty array. Using random names which don't exist there will result in an exception.
> It is usually a good idea to use the `acmailer.mailservice.default` service name for runtime configured services.
